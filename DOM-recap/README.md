# DOM-Recap
This exercice sums up everything covered in other subfolders (creating Nodes, navigation, key events, shuffle content, *setAttribute*, ... ).   
Once again the point is to **use only Javascript** without without having to modify the *index.html* file.
## TO DO's:

1. Iterate through `<ul>`'s children;
2. Move the *Fast and Furious* element to the top of the list + add it a class *"important"*;
3. Remove duplicates;
4. Add an event on every item so that when the user clicks it, an alert pops up to display the movie's title (except for the first one which will display a custom message);
5. Add key events so when the user presses the "R" key, movies get randomly sorted (except F&F which will stay on top no matther what) and when "d" key is pressed, *"Fast & Furious"* copied and added at the end of the list;
6. Insert a `select` input above the list and add it two options: *"important franchises"* and *"normal franchises"*;
7. When the user selects *"important franchises"*, list only shows items with class *important", when the user selects *"normal franchises"*, list only shows the other ones.
